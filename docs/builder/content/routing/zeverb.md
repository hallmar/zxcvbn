<img src="/static/zeverb.png" class="fr">

Any clade can route its output through the "Zeverb" reverb effect. This is a reverb specific to *zxcvbn*. The majority of this reverb is written by [Jean Pierre Cimalando](https://github.com/jpcima), based on the reverbator by [Jon Dattorro](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~dattorro/EffectDesignPart1.pdf). The reverb has been amended with a shimmer.

In each clade you can define the send to the reverb with `PARAMS > send reverb`, from 0 to 100%. The send for the zeverb exists as a command ([z](#zeverb)).

The reverb itself can be adjusted by setting the parameters in the `PARAMS > ZEVERB` menu.
