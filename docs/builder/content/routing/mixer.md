There is a high level way to manage levels of various parameters by using the mixer page. You can open this page at any time by pressing *ctrl* + *L*. The screen that appears will display a particular parameter (labeled at the top), for each of the 10 tracks. Next to this bar will be two grayed bars that show the current audio output for that given track (effects are not taken to account here though). 

To use this page you can use *E2* to change the parameter modulated and *E3* to change the amount of modulation when changing it. Then you can use the keybard to modulate parameters - *0-9* will increase and *Q-P* will decrease the parameter respectively for each track. For example, you can hold *1* to increase the parameter for track 1, or hold *Q* to decrease it.
