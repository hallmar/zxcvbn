Audio input is routed through the norns in a way that bypasses the normal monitor and is instead routed through the internal engine directly. The internal engine allows you to manipulate both channels independently and apply filters, panning, reverb, delay and modulate compression.

The `audio in` option determines whether both channels are manipulated in tandem, or independently. By switching it to `stereo` it behaves as it does traditionally - the channels are left and right and can be hard-panned. If changed to `mono+mono` you can pan each channel independently and modulate the volume of each independently. This is useful if you have two different instruments coming in on the two channels.
