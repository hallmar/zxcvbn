If using crow, this clade allows you to send pitch information to two outputs and envelopes or gates to the other two outputs. This clade either can be set to outputs 1+2 or outputs 3+4. Outputs 1 and 3 are pitch and outputs 2 and 4 are envelopes or gates. Gates are dependant on the hold parameter. There is additionally a slew parameter for the pitch outputs that can be set via the TLI with shortcode 'N' or in the parameters menu.
