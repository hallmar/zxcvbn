Midi devices can also be controlled. Midi devices accept pitch information. You can select the midi clade, and then below that you can select the device and the channel output. (Note the volume still appears as `dB` but it is automatically scaled as midi values). There is additionally a cc parameter that sends midi cc value every note that can be set via the TLI with shortcode 'j' or in the parameters menu. MIDI start/stop messages are also sent to the current MIDI device in the clade when CTRL+SPACE is used to start and stop all the clades.
